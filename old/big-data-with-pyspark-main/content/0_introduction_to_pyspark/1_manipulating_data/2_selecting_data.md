# Select the first set of columns
selected1 = flights.select("tailnum", "origin", "dest")

# Select the second set of columns
temp = flights.select(flights.origin, flights.dest, flights.carrier)

# Define first filter
filterA = flights.origin == "SEA"

# Define second filter
filterB = flights.dest == "PDX"
