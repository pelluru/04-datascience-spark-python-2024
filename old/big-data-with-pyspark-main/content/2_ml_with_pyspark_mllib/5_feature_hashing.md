# Feature hashing and LabelPoint


```


# Create a HashingTf instance with 200 features
tf = HashingTF(numFeatures=200)

# Map each word to one feature
spam_features = tf.transform(spam_words)
non_spam_features = tf.transform(non_spam_words)

# Label the features: 1 for spam, 0 for non-spam
spam_samples = spam_features.map(lambda features:LabeledPoint(1, features))
non_spam_samples = non_spam_features.map(lambda features:LabeledPoint(0, features))

# Combine the two datasets
samples = spam_samples.join(non_spam_samples)
