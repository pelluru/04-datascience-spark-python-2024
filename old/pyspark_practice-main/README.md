# 🐍💥 Pyspark Practice

[⚠️🚧👷🛠️ Work in progress: This repo will be constantly updated with new excercises & their best solutions]

Recently I got an opportunity to work on Pyspark. 🐍💥

To strengthen my unnderstanding, I undertook these excercises. 🚀

The excercises are taken from : https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises

Since, I'm still learning, the answers may not be the best possible ones. Feel free to correct me. 😊 
Also, I couldn't find solutions to some of the excercises. Please help me! 👐

Suggestions and collaborations are more than welcome.🙂
Please open an issue or make a PR indicating the exercise and your problem/solution.
