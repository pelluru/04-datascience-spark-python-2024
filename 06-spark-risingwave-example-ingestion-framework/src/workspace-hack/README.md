# How this magic works

This crate is managed by [`cargo-hakari`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-hakari).

For an explanation of what workspace-hack packages are and how they make your builds faster, see the `cargo-hakari`'s [doc](https://docs.rs/cargo-hakari/latest/cargo_hakari/about/index.html). Shortly speaking, it forces the workspace to use the unified features, regardless of which package is being built.
