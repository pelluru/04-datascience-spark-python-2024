# Debugging


## Debug playground using vscode

To step through risingwave locally with a debugger you can use the `launch.json` and the `tasks.json` provided in `vscode_suggestions`. After adding these files to your local `.vscode` folder you can debug and set breakpoints by launching `Launch 'risingwave p' debug`.
