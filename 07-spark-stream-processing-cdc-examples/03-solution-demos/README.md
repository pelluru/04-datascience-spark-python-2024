# Solution demonstrations

The demos in this directory aim to demonstrate how to build a streaming data pipeline for real-world industry applications. All demos can be run using Docker Compose for ease of set up and include detailed deployment instructions.

Here are the runnable demos so far:

* [Real-time energy grid monitoring](/03-solution-demos/energy_grid/readme.md): Monitor the energy consumption and production patterns of an energy grid in real-time using Kafka, PostgreSQL, RisingWave, and Grafana.

* [Real-time flight tracking system](/03-solution-demos/flights_tracking/readme.md): Keep track of live flight data from Aviationstack API using Kafka, RisingWave, and Metabase.

* [Real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and anomaly detection](/03-solution-demos/iot_demo/readme.md): Detect anomalies in real-time for PBL86-80 motors using MQTT, RisingWave, and Grafana.

* [Wikipedia edits monitoring system](/03-solution-demos/wikipedia_monitoring/readme.md): Track contributions made to Wikipedia pages in real time using the Wikipedia API, Kafka, and RisingWave.
