# Spark in Python

- master manages splitting up the data and the computations.
- master is connected to the rest of the computers in the cluster, which are called worker. 
- master sends the workers data and calculations to run, and they send their results back to the master.
- creating the connection is as simple as creating an instance of the SparkContext class.
